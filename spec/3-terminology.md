SEO, short for search engine optimization, is about helping search engines understand the websiteâ€™s content, helping users find the site, and making a decision about whether they should visit the website. Search engines are increasingly providing rich snippets from the site so that users can find the answer to many questions without ever visiting the site. This can be a bonus for user experience.&#x20;
