# 8 Synergies with other GovStack Building Blocks

The integration between the CMS building block and other GovStack building blocks can enhance the effectiveness of the project implementation and create a consistent experience for the end users with optimal use of technical infrastructure resources.

Such integrations should especially be aimed at the following building blocks:

* **Workflow**: The CMS building block can offer access to e-services implemented using the Workflow building block. In G2C or G2B e-service delivery, the CMS can initiate a request through a web form determining the starting of a new process instance, retrieve the status of a request and deliver notifications. The CMS building block can also support the digitalization of G2G workflows through access-restricted web interfaces. Intranets can enable processes to be initiated through form submission, data verification, and approval workflows. In general, the CMS can provide the end-user interface for the Workflow building block.&#x20;
* **Consent**: The CMS building block provide online interfaces allowing the data subject (the user providing consent for the use of their data) to view data agreements and give or revoke consent.
* **Digital Registries**: The CMS building block can offer online interfaces for accessing and querying digital registries. This includes the possibility of aggregating, processing, and analyzing data retrieved from registries, for example, through web-based dashboards.

**Cloud infrastructure**: The CMS building block relies on hosting infrastructure. Modern CMSs allow for fully automated, software-defined deployment across multiple environments.
